              <div class="callout">
                <p>
                  Our universe is not the cold and uncaring place once described by Newtonian physics. That was a story about a perfectly tuned machine. In Newton’s universe everyone’s fate was already determined and little changed as a result of your existence. Human life, indeed, was utterly independent from the gears that moved much of this clock-like universe. Though the equations and experiments that gave birth to this narrative have undergone a fundamental change, this is the story we still often hear today when scientists describe the nature of our universe. One of the last big paradigm shifts happened when the equations of quantum physics and chaos theory provided a glimpse into a world vastly different from the familiar one we experience. That change was so great it altered the very questions we ask. We learned that the universe around us was intricately more connected than we could have previously imagined, even across vast distances of space. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  Despite these foundational changes to the equations we use to describe nature, most people still think science is telling us the same familiar story about the nature of our universe. That the vast expanses of stars and planets have little in common with human existence; only now physicists generally agree that our universe has a chaotic and probabilistic character. There have been several attempts to use the equations of chaos theory and quantum physics to argue for other paradigm shifts. A common fallacy among these attempts has been the desire to attribute the weird workings of quantum particles to the physically larger world that humans experience. Where scientists see weird connections between particles over extremely vast distances, the advocates for some of these attempted new paradigms argued that this meant there must also be weird connections between human experiences across vast distances. But the truth is, scientific experiments in quantum physics neither demonstrate this human level connection, nor predict it. These types of pop culture beliefs have made many scientists skeptical about any claims of a new scientific paradigm for the nature of our universe, and rightly so.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Today a new paradigm appears on the horizon. Our emerging paradigm needs to address such skepticism. Here we find that our paradigm’s strength comes from the fact that it is a story the scientists themselves are telling, and relies wholly on the experimental discoveries of our universe as we currently know it. This paradigm is marked by a new understanding of cooperation. In the past two decades the debate over the origin of cooperative behavior, long believed to be an aberration, has steadily increased. A number of publications are now dealing directly with the topic. A recent report on National Public Radio stated: “There are researchers in economics, evolutionary biology and psychology, and the law all training their own lenses on this multidisciplinary field that has become known as cooperation theory.”
                </p>
                <p>
                  The story of cooperation theory begins with an understanding of energy and the role it plays in the lifespan of all things. When we examine the world around us, we can easily understand the basic role different types of energies play in everyday life. Our cellular phones need electrical energy to work. When the battery runs low, we plug them into a source of electrical energy to charge the battery. Most of our cars run on combustion energy. Some of us may not understand what that means, but we know that gas goes in and the car keeps moving when we turn the key. If the gas tank goes empty, the car stops moving. Our bodies run on biological energy. Even fewer of us understand how food is turned into muscle movements, but we all feel hunger and know we need food to survive. These examples all share the same pattern, of energy going into a system in order to keep it working in various ways. Each example consumes a different type of energy: electrical, combustion, and biological. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  Our hunger story stands out from the other two examples in that if we don’t eat, if we run out of energy, we will die. Not only will we die, but the cells of our body will slowly start to break down into dust. In contrast, when my car runs out of gas, I can leave it empty for a month and in all likelihood, the engine will still start when I turn the key. If I leave that gas tank empty for a few years, I’ll need to clean some parts, but with the right storage the engine can still produce combustion energy from gasoline. However, when we talk to a particle physicist about our car, she will tell a story that closely resembles the energy needs of our body. It’s just that this takes a much longer time to play out. More importantly, it plays out on a scale much too small for the human eye. On the microscopic level we find parallels between the decaying human body and the rusting car door. The story she tells sounds familiar because the small particles that make up our car also need energy to survive. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  Let’s focus on the car door’s aluminum metal frame. From our perspective, the aluminum panel is a solid piece of metal, strong enough to protect us from small accidents. For the particle physicist, that aluminum door is just a series of particles being held together by various forms of energy. From the larger molecules to the smaller quarks, these particles require energy to bind together and survive as a unit, just like our body. Our physicist might even say the particles themselves are energy, bound together. The tiny size of these particles means the energy they need is a very small quantity. However, if new energy is not added to the system, the bonds that hold these particles together will eventually fail. Given enough time, our aluminum car door will slowly start to break apart. This example is a small introduction to the scientific concept of entropy. We will explore entropy in more depth, but for now it is important to know that the entire universe is struggling to overcome entropy. From the largest star to the smallest particle, we share a need for useable forms of energy. This struggle against entropy is the foundation of our new paradigm.
                </p>
                <p>
                  One final thought before we continue with our story. Philosophy and science have recently been portrayed as existing in a state of competition for truth. Some prominent scientists even suggest that philosophy is no longer needed, as if data and repeatability are all that is required in our pursuit of truths about the universe we live in. If you find yourself empathizing with this position, or are simply curious about the relationship between philosophy and science, you are encouraged to conduct a modest literature review of the “Philosophy of Science”. Much of the interpretation of scientific experiments, the theories we use to make scientific predictions, are based on which scientific philosophy we adhere to. For instance, depending on the philosophical position of the scientists interpreting the data, our repeatable studies are either describing a truth about realty, or simply falsifying provably wrong explanations for reality but never actually reaching “truth”. I bring this up now because the story being told here is one of both philosophy and science. There are philosophical implications to understanding what the current science is telling us about the nature of our universe, and the connections between us and the world we inhabit. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  In a public forum I attended, the famous physicist Leon Lederman was asked to elaborate on the relationship between philosophy and science. He described science like a pyramid. Physics constituted the solid base, while chemistry occupied the softer middle, and the life sciences were on the top. And philosophy? She stands on the outside jealously gazing at the beautiful structure.

                    Ever since something came from nothing—or nothing became something—everything is in a constant struggle to overcome death. Scientifically, this is expressed by the second law of thermodynamics. This empirically validated law of physics states that all things, left to their own devices, will fall into ever-greater disorder. The ultimate outcome of this general trend toward chaos is death—the return of something back to nothing; no plants or animals, no planets, no stars, no galaxies, no movement or variation at all from one place to another. Just an endless and uniform field of nothingness. What physicist call the heat death of our universe. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Lucky for us, the second law of thermodynamics is preceded by the first law, which states that all energy, in the final account, remains constant. Energy must be preserved. This means that ultimately, should everything return to nothing; nothingness is in confrontation with all the energy there is. Pure energy, the sum of all matter in the universe, is in constant struggle with nothingness; or, to express it somewhat differently, there is pure energy, and besides pure energy, there is nothing. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This leads us to some of the biggest unsolved questions in modern science: If the second law reigns supreme, how is it possible for life to escape its throngs, even if only temporarily? How can order exist in a sea of chaos? How can conscious beings, such as you and I, evolve from an otherwise completely unintentional universe? How could mind emerge from mindless matter? How could anything complex emerge from this impending demise?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It appears that to prevent this “falling back into nothingness”, the universe has found ways to create order out of chaos. Amid chaos, pockets of order appeared surrounded by disorder. All of nature—the entirety of the visible universe—is in an ongoing struggle at every level to escape the gaping abyss of nothingness. According to traditional scientific positivism, the material world consists of inanimate matter composed mostly of inorganic chemistry that, in the words of Terrence Deacon,  can be “reasonably well” explained by a “common set of physical equations” . This universe, according to Newtonian physics, is ruled by predestiny and chance of circumstance. The movement of any object simply follows from the external forces of cause and effect placed upon it. Following the second law, all things are on a march toward extinction. The scientific measure for the grade of disorder is expressed as entropy. Left to its own device, entropy would continuously increase, and the whole universe would eventually end up in thermodynamic equilibrium. Nothing could exist in such a universe—no plants, no animals, and no human beings.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Imagine two adjacent rooms. One room is filled with poisonous gas, the other has an invisible caretaker who has lovingly assembled a luscious green habitat, which is the home of a cute, nearly extinct, cuddly panda. Now imagine some irresponsible keeper leaves the door between those two rooms wide open. The laws of thermodynamics assure us that the poisonous gas would seep into the panda’s habitat. We could assume that in desperation the panda would run into the other room, but to no avail. Eventually, our panda, the plants, and everything else alive would wither away. This is what happens when entropy is at its highest level—equilibrium of the gas in both rooms would be achieved, and both rooms would be equally poisonous for every living thing. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If the second law of thermodynamics had its way, the fate of the universe would be worse. It would not leave anything untouched. Everything would disappear—no more cute pandas anywhere, no rocks, no rivers, no forests, and no stars in the night sky. It would be a place without differentiation, the great void, the ultimate nothingness. Throughout the course of the nineteenth century, people began to grasp the implications of the second law, causing a great desperation among scientists. One writer imagined the universe as a giant fish bowl with human beings as the fish. Above it an evil god took pleasure in watching the fish slowly wither away.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Other writers cautioned against accepting this catastrophe as the ultimate fate of the universe. Looking carefully at our immediate world, they concluded that something must slow down the decay and stop, or at least delay, the looming disaster. Living things seemed to counteract the second law. Life has managed to build little islands of order in this disorderly, strange, and dangerous world. How can life be so different?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In his recent book, Incomplete Nature—How Mind Emerged from Matter, Terrence Deacon speculates that when living things appeared on earth some three billion years ago, the universe made a “radical about-face.” At that point, according to Deacon, a “reversal of typical thermodynamic tendencies” happened that led to a “fundamental reorganization.”  Deacon claims that at that moment, “the reliable one-dimensional lockstep of just one thing after another, which had exclusively characterized physical events throughout the universe, took an abrupt turn and headed the other way.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The cause for this monumental transition, which evidently counteracted the universal trend toward increasing disorder, is described by Deacon as an “essentially new form of organization,” powerful enough to negate the destructive effects of the second law. This new organizational form, which introduces order, awareness, relationship, and cooperation, is often called negentropy. While modern scientists are by no means in agreement what negentropy really is, or even whether it truly exists, there can be no doubt that with the appearance of the first human beings on this earth, the quest for meaning, for order, the judgment of value and beauty were introduced in a way no one could claim existed here before. Even the most steadfast materialists—those who claim that there can only be matter and that the human mind is the mere firing of electrons and possibly nothing more than an illusion—would have to admit that nonliving material things couldn’t even have the illusion of a mind. Therefore, human beings, perhaps other animals, and possibly even plants, are fundamentally different from rocks and stardust. Or are they? Is that really where the evidence leads, or have we made a premature assertion about the nature of reality?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    More importantly, what brought this monumental transition about? How could something as complex and mysterious as mind appear out of thin air? How could awareness and consciousness spring out of nothing? How could anything come out of nothing? The answer is collective orchestration. The story I am about to tell in this book is one of relationships, communication, and cooperation.

                    As we will see, nature has found an escape route. Through effective cooperation, individuals can move as a single unit into a higher level of complexity, leaving uncooperative members behind. It is as if—in the words of social psychologist Jonathan Haidt—“a staircase to a secret door opens to seemingly nowhere.”  Whenever in the history of the universe a group of individuals effectively cooperates, a door may open to a room no one knew existed. It is still the same house, the same universe. But now there is a new plateau, with new possibilities and new vistas. Those individuals, who have managed to establish themselves on the next higher level, collectively form a new organism, a kind of superorganism that can procreate at the higher level. Through cooperation, what started out as many has become one – in a higher dimension of freedom; e pluribus unum. But they are safe only for a short while. Still living in the same home and obeying the same laws, uncooperative free riders will eventually try to spoil their success. The spoilers keep tearing away at the foundation, while random mutation creates new free riders among the higher rank. Again, escape is possible through renewed cooperation. Individuals work together, and collectively they create yet another new superorganism, a new individual capable of populating the next higher level. And so the game of creation and destruction continues. Eventually, it brings forth our wonderful world, a highly complex mansion with many rooms and many floors, and many dimensions. At every level, destruction and death are possible. But those who cooperate can escape, at least for a while. Perhaps everything in the universe is driven by the dim awareness that together, as a group, new vistas are possible and new horizons are within reach. Death can be overcome, if only temporarily. But most of all, the whole universe is in a constant struggle to survive. I hope to make a convincing argument to demonstrate that in the ongoing game of survival, nature favors cooperation over competition, and as a by-product, creates a hierarchy of increasingly more complex systems. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The “new organizational form” Deacon talks about is based on a principle I call collective orchestration. Once aware of it, I found collective orchestration happening at all levels of nature, not only among living things. Gone is Deacon’s simplistic model of an early universe that moves in easily understandable regularity. Collective orchestration occurs not only among living things but is part of the evolution of molecules, atoms, and all the other elementary particles. It finally occurred to me that space-time is the result of the successful orchestration of even more elementary space-time particles. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    My hypotheses is that in nature, at every level, individuals may cooperate and synchronize, and under certain conditions act as one. A new individual of higher complexity emerges, which fits a phenomenon Darwin called “super-organism.” While Darwin used this term only to describe social phenomena that he had observed among insects, I will show that the same process is ubiquitous, producing superorganisms at all levels. A super-organism is a collective that exhibits qualities not present at the level of the lower-grade individuals. These qualities lead to an increase in complexity, which is responsible for the apparent hierarchical order in nature. This process is not a mere accidental result of random mutations or coincidences. Rather, the observed cooperation, synchronization, and creation of super-organisms is nature’s strategy to prevent extinction; by effectively counteracting the second law of thermodynamics. Though, never negating it. At every level, there are individuals who have a natural tendency to cooperate. Through random mutation, some individuals may evolve who selfishly take advantage of the cooperating group. Such uncooperative free riders may occur in any group. They can take over and eventually destroy any natural system. Thus, the immense complexity and hierarchical structure in nature is the result of a communal effort—the outcome of a universal cooperative principle I call “collective orchestration.” 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But why is collective orchestration necessary for evolution? The short answer is: cooperation preserves energy. To avoid premature decay or even death, every organism must preserve energy. The premiere way to preserve energy is through cooperation. By being able to collectively advance, those who cooperate gain a clear advantage in the evolutionary race.

                <h3 id="ch2">Chapter 2: <small class="black">Faust’s Wager with the Devil</small></h3>
                <div class="callout">
                  <p>
                    “If to the moment I shall ever say…” The legendary character Faust makes a wager with the devil, promising to turn over his soul as payment for a moment of bliss. In Johann Wolfgang von Goethe’s version of the Faust story, Mephistopheles, the prince of darkness, makes every possible attempt to provide Faust with such a moment of eternal bliss. He offers him the innocence of a young love, lets him drink from the fountain of youth, tries to corrupt him with the seduction of imperial power, and finally reveals to him the deepest secrets of nature. The devil even guides him down to the source of all being—the eternal mothers, a place not even the devil is able to visit. Despite this gigantic effort, Faust remains deeply unsatisfied. Nothing could provide him with a moment of complete bliss—a moment that would be so desirable, so perfect, that no other wish remains. Faust rushes on, from one desire to the next, from one fulfillment to another. “Oh, that in this world naught perfect is, I now do see” he cries out, bemoaning the deep dissatisfaction with God’s creation.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Goethe wrote and rewrote his Faust story for most of his adult life. At eighty-two years of age, when he finally passed away, he had completed the second part of his Faust epic. As an aging sage, he found an answer to Faust’s quest. In a utopian vision, Faust projects the perfect cooperation of a proud and free people. If such cooperation could ever be achieved among human beings, Faust fantasizes, then he would truly experience the moment of bliss he so desires. At that moment he would gladly turn over his soul to the devil. In isolation, an individual cannot reach bliss. Bliss has to be the result of a communal effort. As a group, we can lift ourselves out of the misery of existence and escape death. Collectively, as a cooperating group of equals, we can move to a higher plain. Not unlike the mystical body of Christ, which is established wherever two or three believers are gathered in His name, Goethe offers a secular, nonsectarian vision of mystical harmony: the harmonious cooperation of working people, who collectively can defeat death and establish perfect harmony.

                    Today most of us are embracing an increasingly individualistic culture. As a character, Goethe’s Faust is the quintessential individualist. Individualism is a historical construction based on the essential values created during the European Renaissance. Disconnected from tribe and family, Faust is the product of his education, wholly responsible for his actions and in charge of his destiny. Even with all his knowledge and advanced doctoral degrees—Faust studied all the learned subjects of his time—he cannot find satisfaction or happiness. Perhaps, as modern psychology is increasingly demonstrating, happiness cannot be found within the individual, but is somehow deeply connected to relationships and to others.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Western civilization has birthed the individual and has come to deify it. Let me hurry to say that by no means do I advocate deconstruction of the self, nor do I intend to downplay the extraordinary significance of this historical achievement. It is responsible for the incomparable advances that propelled Western civilization to the forefront of the world’s cultures. But we should never forget that individualism and the focus on the autonomous worth of each individual is a rather recent development, unknown to human beings walking the earth for millions of years. Early human beings lived in groups and were identified by their group. Persons derived their worth from the tribe or the family they belonged to. Without that identity, a man’s value was his physical strength, or sometimes it was the sheer power of a cunning mind. In the absence of these characteristics, a man was worth nothing. Some of the oldest stories, such as Homer’s Iliad, were records of battles between tribes, of wars, and epic movements of groups of peoples. Other stories reported the life of heroes such as Odysseus and Gilgamesh, men who distinguished themselves from the rest of the unnamed masses by their physical power and their often-godlike deeds.

                    Beginning with Homer’s writings in the eighth century BCE, classical Greek society began focusing increasingly more on the history, fate, and value of the individual person. Homer’s second great epic, the Odyssey, narrowly focused on the journey of its hero. Odysseus was known—often in advance—to those he met on his journey, as a man of great knowledge, courage, wisdom, and power. While his traveling companions remained mostly a faceless crowd, cunning Odysseus distinguished himself by his incredible wit, foresight, and by the ability to consume wine without getting drunk. When the witch Circe seduced Odysseus’s group with an orgy of alcohol consumption, Odysseus’s companions turned into pigs. Odysseus alone remained his unwavering self. Promptly, the witch recognized her famous guest.

                    By the time the Greek philosophers, the famous founders of Western philosophical discourse (most importantly, Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle), walked the earth, the idea of the individual worth of a person began to take hold in Greek society. From here, the idea of individualism began its triumphant march around the globe. It still attracts new converts and is changing perspectives, especially in Africa and Asia, continents where communal and collective societies have survived the longest. I recently visited the opening of an art show at a gallery in Beijing, China. The painting collection was presented under the theme, Who am I? The art show was a study on the growing influence Western ideas of self are having on Chinese society and art. Traditional Chinese art rarely focuses on representations of a single person. More common are depictions of a group of people or nature, in which the human being is depicted as a mere part of the whole.

                    Under the influence of the great logician Aristotle, Greek philosophy, which initially was conceived as the love of wisdom, turned into what is now most often known as the love of knowledge. This may, on the surface, be only a small semantic shift, but its influence on the way we think and see the world is profound. While wisdom draws its insights from a largely emotional base, which is a substrate of communal experience and generations of practice; knowledge is rooted in firmly established mental constructs. These constructs are the result of individual ruminations, mathematical in character and often believed to contain objective truth. In many of his writings, Aristotle showed a sense and appreciation for ancient wisdom that is deposited in his view of average people. He referred to their insights as the “wisdom of the multitude.” But his influence on Western thought came mostly from his ontological foundation of universals and his powerful system of logical deduction.

                    The chorus in Greek tragedies preserved the memory of ancient crowd wisdom. The chorus often exhibited superior wisdom when compared to the knowledge of its heroes. Judgments in Greek courts were made by a large group of jurors, usually five hundred men, continuing the ancient belief that a group of people could come closer to the truth than individual judges. Today, in the execution of justice, most modern courts trust the rule of law as interpreted by learned judges, while others continue the use of juries, which are made up of ordinary citizens. In drama, neoclassical aesthetics eliminated the role of the chorus and focused narrowly on the treatment of its hero, thus continuing the trend to individualization. In the visual arts, since the Renaissance, the artist zoomed in on the personal features of individual characters, powerful religious or social leaders. In philosophy, Descartes’s cogito ergo sum decisively directed any quest for certainty and absoluteness to be funneled through the narrow conduit of the individual self. Modernity, the modern world through the eyes of postclassical liberalism, paid homage to the individual, assuming that rationality and reason would not only crack the riddle of existence but also solve the problems found in the foundation of morality itself.

                    More recently, the belief in the wisdom of the multitude, now called the wisdom of crowds, experienced an interesting comeback. Some psychologists and social scientists began to research knowledge and wisdom that can apparently be found in crowds. James Surowiecki begins his recent book on The Wisdom of Crowds by cautioning: “One of the striking things about the wisdom of crowds is that even though its effects are all around us, it’s easy to miss, and, even when it’s seen, it can be hard to accept.”

                  <p>
                    According to Surowiecki, empirical research shows that consulting a properly composed group of average people may often yield superior results to consulting an expert. Evidently, the key to getting good results lies in the very composition of the group. Groups that are composed of a greater variety of people, such as members of different ethnic, religious, and cultural backgrounds, have a greater chance in achieving credible results than homogeneous groups consisting of members who are quite similar to each other.

                    It would seem that contrary to the popular assumption that individual genius is always superior to the knowledge of average people, the group as a whole might actually know better than any one individual, especially when it is the result of effective cooperation. But what is the situation in the animal world?

                    When it comes to numbers, it has long been known that insects are the most successful species. Darwin already observed that insects, like no other species in the world, have learned how to cooperate. But are insects also smart? National Geographic’s staff writer Peter Miller thinks they are; not as individuals, but as crowds or as colonies. In an article, “The Genius of Swarms,”  Miller introduces the astounding abilities and achievements of entire colonies of certain insects such as bees. He credits the tendency to cooperate that gives these animals at least the appearance of a certain group intelligence. Miller asks the provocative question: “Does nature employ cooperation in the same way it uses natural selection, competition, and random mutation?” He says that in search of an answer he “came upon some strange phenomena of synchronized and collective behavior in the world around us.”

                  <p>
                    Could it be that crowd intelligence is not limited to human beings but can readily be found among animals? Collective orchestration seems to unravel the mystery of intelligent crowds.
